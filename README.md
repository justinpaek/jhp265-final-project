# jhp265-final-project

Contains source code for the final project. The code is split into two different files. Part 1 is in model_behavior.jl, which contains the code that carries out the implementation of the extended thermodynamic model for cell-cell adhesion. Part 2, which uses this model to evaluate a simple phase separation criterion, is in the file separation_criterion.jl.
